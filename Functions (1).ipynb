        " - A function is a block of code that is defined using the def keyword and can be called independently.\n",
        "Functions are not tied to any particular object.Functions are called directly by their name: function_name().\n",
        "- Example -\n",
        "      def add(a, b):\n",
        "          return a + b\n",
        "      result(5+4)\n",
        "      print(result)\n",
        " - A method is a function that is associated with an object, often an instance of a class.\n",
        "Methods are defined inside a class and are called on an instance of that class.\n",
        "Methods typically operate on the data within the object they are associated with and may modify the state of that object.\n",
        "- Example -\n",
        "       class Calculator:\n",
        "          def add(self, a, b):\n",

        "       result = calc.add(5, 3)\n",
        "       print(result)\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        " - Function arguments refer to the values or data we provide to a function when we call it. These values are assigned to the function's parameters so the function can use them to perform its task.\n",
        "  -  Function parameters are the variables that we define inside the parentheses in the function's declaration. These parameters act as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function when it is called.\n",
        "- Example -\n",
        "      def add_numbers(a, b):  # a and b are function parameters\n",

        "      \n",
        "3.  What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        " - There are different ways to define and call functions, depending on how you want to structure your code and how flexible the function should be:\n",
        "- 1. Defining and Calling a Simple Function -\n",
        "The most basic way to define and call a function is by using the def keyword.   \n",
        "       \n",
        "         def greet(name):\n",
        "            print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "         greet(\"Alice\")  \n",
        "- 2. Function with Parameters and Return Value -\n",
        "We can define a function that takes parameters and returns a value.\n",
        "-3. Function with Default Parameters -\n",
        "Functions can have default values for parameters. If the caller doesn’t provide a value for those parameters, the default is used.\n",
        "-4. Calling a Function with Keyword Arguments -\n",
        "When calling a function, you can pass arguments by explicitly naming them, which allows you to pass arguments in any order.\n",
        "-5. Function with Variable-Length Arguments (*args and **kwargs) - We can define functions that accept a variable number of arguments using *args (for positional arguments) and **kwargs (for keyword arguments).\\\n",
        "-6. Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions) -\n",
        "Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined with the lambda keyword. They can take any number of arguments but only have one expression.\n",
        "-7. Function with No Parameters (Empty Function) -\n",
        "You can define a function that doesn't take any parameters, simply performing an action when called.\n",
        "-8. Recursive Function -\n",
        "A function that calls itself is called a recursive function. This is useful for problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar problems (like calculating factorials).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        " - The purpose of the return statement in a Python function is to send a result or value back from the function to the place where the function was called. It allows the function to output a result after performing some operations or calculations, enabling further use of that result in the rest of the program.\n",
        "          def add(a, b):\n",
        "            result = a + b\n",

        "           # Output: 8\n",
        "5.  What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        " - An iterator in Python is an object that allows us to traverse through a collection of items, such as a list, tuple, or string, one element at a time. It does this by implementing two key methods: __iter__() and __next__().           \n",
        "- Iterable: An iterable is any Python object that can return an iterator. It supports the __iter__() method.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Iterator: An iterator is an object that keeps track of its current state during iteration and implements both __iter__() and __next__() methods.\n",
        "- Example -\n",
        "       # List is an iterable\n",
        "       my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "\n",
        "       # Convert it to an iterator using iter()\n",
        "       iterator = iter(my_list)\n",
        "\n",
        "       # Using the iterator to fetch elements one by one\n",
        "       print(next(iterator))  # Output: 1\n",
        "       print(next(iterator))  # Output: 2\n",
        "       print(next(iterator))  # Output: 3\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        " - Generators are a simple way to create iterators using functions and the yield keyword instead of returning values.\n",
        "- Key Concepts of Generators:\n",
        "- 1. yield: Instead of returning a value with the return statement, a generator function uses the yield keyword to produce a value. This allows the function to pause its state and resume when the next value is requested.\n",
        "- 2. Memory Efficiency: Generators are lazy; they generate values one by one as needed, so they don’t require storing all values in memory at once. This makes them more efficient for large datasets.\n",
        "-3. Stateful: Generators maintain their state between each call, so they can resume execution from where they left off.  \n",
        "- Generators are defined using functions with the yield.\n",
        "           \n",
        "           def count_up_to(limit):\n",
        "              count = 1\n",
        "              while count <= limit:\n",
        "           yield count  # Generate the current value and pause here\n",
        "           count += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "           # Creating a generator object\n",
        "           counter = count_up_to(3)\n",
        "\n",
        "           # Using the generator with next()\n",
        "           print(next(counter))  # Output: 1\n",
        "           print(next(counter))  # Output: 2\n",
        "           print(next(counter))  # Output: 3\n",
        "7.  What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        " - Generators offer several significant advantages over regular functions (those that return values with return), especially in terms of memory efficiency, performance, and flexibility.\n",
        "- 1. Memory Efficiency (Lazy Evaluation) -  One of the primary advantages of generators is that they are memory efficient.\n",
        "- 2. Performance Efficiency (Lazy Evaluation) -\n",
        "Generators allow lazy evaluation, meaning they evaluate each item only when it is needed. This can be more performance efficient when you only need to process part of a sequence.\n",
        "- 3. Handling Infinite Sequences -\n",
        "Generators are ideal for representing infinite sequences. Regular functions cannot return infinite sequences, as they would try to generate and store the entire sequence in memory.\n",
        "- 4. Simpler Code for Iterators -\n",
        "Creating custom iterators using generators can be much simpler and more readable than using regular classes with __iter__() and __next__() methods.\n",
        "- 5. Avoiding the Need to Load Large Data Sets -\n",
        "When working with large datasets (e.g., reading from a file, or processing big databases), generators allow you to process each data item one at a time without loading everything into memory at once.\n",
        "- 6. Enhanced Readability and Clean Code -\n",
        "Generators simplify the code, making it more readable. For example, a generator is easier to understand than using a list comprehension or manually managing the state of an iterator.     \n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        " -  Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword.\n",
        "- They are used for creating small, throwaway functions without the need to formally define a function using def.\n",
        "            square =  lamba x: x*x\n",
        "            print(square(5))\n",
        "              \n",
        "              #output- 25\n",
        "9.  Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        " - The map function applies a given function to all items in an input iterable (like a list) and returns an iterator with the results.\n",
        "- Used to transform each item in an iterable by applying the specified function.\n",
        "           numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "\n",
        "           # Using map with a lambda function to square each number\n",
        "           squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x * x, numbers))\n",
        "\n",
        "           print(squared_numbers)  \n",
        "            \n",
        "               # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
